This project involves crafting a web application that showcases a weather forecast using data fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API. Users can effortlessly search for specific global locations or allow automatic detection of their current location (requires location permission), presenting vital weather details.

Highlighted features include the capability to store weather data in both the Redux store and session storage, minimizing reliance on network requests. Users can search for weather details by city, automatically detect and display current weather based on location, view a location map, synchronize data for real-time updates, receive toast notifications for actions, access a pop-up modal for an in-depth seven-day forecast, and experience smooth zoom-in and zoom-out animations. The application is responsive across all screen sizes.

To utilize the app, simply input a city name and click on search/press Enter. Alternatively, click on the "Your Location Weather" button. Upon clicking the button, the app checks if data is available in session storage. If not, it initiates a network request; otherwise, it retrieves data from session storage.
